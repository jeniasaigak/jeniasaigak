### Hi there 👋

👋 Hey there! I'm Eugene Saigak, a Senior Full Stack Engineer with 7 years of experience, based in Petah Tikva, Israel 🇮🇱.
I'm passionate about crafting robust Back-end solutions and exploring the limitless possibilities of technologies.

- 🚀 I'm proficient in: **JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Nest.js, React, React Native** and more!
- 🛠️ While I'm not a Go ninja (yet!), I have a soft spot for its simplicity and efficiency. I'm currently exploring the Go-sphere and enjoying every bit of it!
- 🔧 Since 2021, I'm weaving magic with Neovim for my development escapades ✨.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Back in 2009, my coding journey kicked off with ActionScript 3.0 and Free Pascal
